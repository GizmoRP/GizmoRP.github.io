								<h3><center>Welcome to our Server and Thank you for choosing us!</center></h3>
								<dl>
									<dt><u>Getting Started</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>After you have joined our server, you get to make yourself a fully customizable character and then procceeds to spawning randomly into our server. This is where the fun begins! We offer alot of things to do in our community, such as several different legal and illegal jobs, several different houses and apartmens to choose from, hundreds of different cars and bikes to choose from, but lets not forget our limited amount of boats and aircraft available for purchase!</p>
									</dd>
									<dt><u>Making a Name of Yourself</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>The time is now here to earn yourself access to the big boys. You get the choice of becoming an outlaw or earn money the good old legal way. Whichever suits you the best, but choose wisely! </p>
										<p>However, if you are dedicated enough, you could always apply for one of the big jobs in the Mechanics or the Emergency-services. Or maybe you want to become a member of the Police? You can apply for the job on this website if interested as we are <b>always</b> hiring new members to the teams.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt><u>Basics of Roleplaying</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>We strongly suggest <a href="index.html">reading the rules</a> here on our website before doing anything at all however, due to the fact that we are a Roleplay-community. This means that you have to stay in character at all times. If you get stopped by the Police for running a red light, you have to stay in Character and play it out. This applies for any type of event happening ingame. Use <b>/ooc</b> in chat if you absolutely need to go out of character. <b>Remember to have your microphone turned on at all times!</b>
									</dd>
									<dt><u>Have Fun!</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p><p>You are now ready to start your journey on our community! <b>We cannot stress this enough however</b>, but please do us the favor of staying in character at all times and keeping your <b>microphone <u>ON</u></b> at all times!
											<p>Welcome to our server and again, thank you for choosing us!</p>
